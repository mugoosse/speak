/// Secure input exists to keep keyloggers away from the keyboard, and at the
/// layer it works on, Speak's chord detection is a keylogger. While it is on,
/// the event tap in `installHotkey` is not handed ordinary key events. Modifier
/// changes can still arrive on some paths, so a modifier-only chord may start a
/// recording while Escape never reaches the tap to cancel it.
///
/// Terminal's Secure Keyboard Entry is the deliberate case, and it stays on
/// until someone unticks it. The accidental case is an app that turns it on
/// for a password field and does not turn it off again, where it outlives the
/// window that wanted it and the user is left with a shortcut that stopped
/// working for no reason they can see.
///
/// Every other way a dictation can fail already says so in the menu: the
/// microphone gets a row and a retry hint, a model that will not load gets a
/// row and a Try again. This is the only failure that can remove some or all
/// keyboard control without telling Speak that anything changed.
